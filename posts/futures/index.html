What are stock index futures?
Stock index futures are financial contracts that require the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, a stock market index, like the S&amp;P 500, at a set price on a specific future date. They let investors bet on or protect against future changes in an index without owning the actual stocks in it.">

Stock index futures are financial contracts that require the buyer to purchase, or the seller to sell, a stock market index, like the S\u0026P 500, at a set price on a specific future date. They let investors bet on or protect against future changes in an index without owning the actual stocks in it.\nAnother benefit they offer is the ability to use high leverage without taking out a loan. No loan means no interest payments, which saves you money. Leverage means you can control a large investment with a small amount of money, amplifying both potential gains and losses.\nIsn’t high leverage bad? This is where nuance comes in. High leverage means higher risk, which should also mean higher potential returns. However, there are ways to mitigate some of the risk, some of which you might already be doing:\nSmall capital: You can’t lose much if you don’t have much to begin with. Starting small limits your exposure. Dollar cost averaging: This is a way to reduce risk by investing a fixed amount regularly, like monthly. While it may yield lower returns compared to lump-sum investing, it’s better for managing risk. It’s also a natural fit for salaried workers who invest from each paycheck. Young people with a long work life ahead: Younger investors have time to recover from losses, as they can keep earning income through their jobs, reducing the impact of a bad trade. Eventually, once your inner dragon is sated and you have hoarded enough capital, your absolute risk will increase because you’re investing more. At this point, you should consider reducing risk by buying fewer futures contracts and putting more money into safer options, like purchasing the ETF itself (e.g., an S\u0026P 500 ETF).\nThere’s also an interesting phenomenon where higher returns can sometimes offset added risk, which is worth keeping in mind.\nWhen to consider reducing leverage As you build wealth, knowing when to scale back risk becomes crucial. Here’s how I’d calculate a rough estimate of when to start reducing leverage. The numbers aren’t exact, so adjust them to fit your needs. I’d consider reducing leverage once I can sustain myself without working. Reducing leverage means gradually lowering how much you borrow to invest, not eliminating it entirely.\nA 4% per year withdrawal rate is often considered safe, though you can withdraw more in good years and less in bad ones. For example, let’s say I need $20,000 annually because I don’t spend much.\n$20,000 ÷ 4% = $500,000\nSo, I’d need $500,000+ of total investment value to start considering reducing leverage. With futures, I can achieve 10x leverage, so that translates to $50,000 in actual capital. For instance, with $50,000, I could control $500,000 worth of S\u0026P 500 futures. As my capital grows beyond this, I’d start shifting some money to ETFs to lower risk.\nHow do stock index futures work in practice? To trade futures, you need a brokerage account that supports futures trading and a margin account, which is like a deposit you put up to cover potential losses. For example, let’s say you want to trade a micro E-mini S\u0026P 500 futures contract. Each contract might represent $5 times the S\u0026P 500 index value. If the index is at 5,000, the contract’s total value is $25,000. With 10x leverage, you might only need $2,500 in your account to control that contract. If the index rises to 5,100, your profit is $500 (100 points x $5). But if it drops, you could lose more than your initial deposit, which is where the risk comes in. Futures contracts also expire (often quarterly), so you’ll need to roll over to a new contract or close your position.\nTax considerations Futures have unique tax rules. In the U.S., they’re taxed under the 60/40 rule: 60% of gains are treated as long-term capital gains (often taxed at a lower rate), and 40% as short-term gains, regardless of how long you hold the contract. This can be advantageous compared to some investments but varies by country.\nFurther reading In the next post I will write about why I picked Russell 2000 index.\nFeedback If you have any suggestions or critique email me. splonk@splonk.party\nThank you for your attention to this matter!\n",
